Before buying it, I researched a little bit and came to a conclusion that this the best (considering the MRP) beginners / learning guitar you can have. Ofcourse there are one or two things which may bother you once you learn more about guitar and chords and frets. But if you are just starting, this is the one to go with.",14 October 2018

3,1.0,"pros:* The guitar has fair sound for its price.* Looks goodCon:* Action is too high, double of what is expectedAction is the distance between the frets and the strings or how high the strings are. If this is too high you would have to press very hard to get a good sound and this will hurt your fingers.Action measured at 12th fret was 0.5mm should be about 0.28mm, ill attach an imageYou might have heard playing guitars usually hurts the fingers but with this it hurts more than it should.As beginner this experience might deter you from learning guitar or practicing more.Learning guitars could be difficult but it shouldn't be a pain.If you are beginner buy guitar from trusted brand accompanied by someone experienced.",30 January 2019

11,5.0,"Writing a review after extensive usage for over two years. This guitar is absolutely one of the best buys ever. Rs. 2000 is an absolute steal. I have a Fender FC and a Yamaha F310 and bought this one since I relocated to another city for two years, and wanted a spare guitar I can junk.Guitar is in perfect shape and I won't be junking it ! Stays tuned for atleast 2-3 days with lots of playing (8-10 hours). Stays tuned afterward too but may need to fine tune. Tone quality is decent. Again, an absolute steal for 2000 rupees.Among companies like Juarez, most of their guitars are good but there can be a chance that you may get 1/10 pieces that are defective. Else it you get a well made piece, this is a great buy",7 June 2020

The guitar bag was wrapped up in the box, along with the plectrums (0.71 mm), extra strings, and the guitar strap. The guitar itself was largely intact; it had a couple of tiny scratches, but they're so small, I couldn't even get a clear enough picture. It has metal strings and the knobs turn smoothly without resistance.

33,1.0,"This product is not worthy enough to purchase. It's heavily coated with paint to hide the flaws, however after 3 days of keeping it in the same cardboard box in which it was delivered the paint which was already coming out a bit, started to come out a lot on its own revealind the actual material used, the neck of the guitar and most of the material is plastic, not wood. I took the guitar to a professional who confirmed it and clearly said that even the sound from this guitar is not accurate or even close to 'accurate'. I didn't play it yet, took it to get tuned, and it turns out that it cannot be tuned properly as well. The strings even after tightening are loosing their grip and as a result after a point it will break or come out as per what the professional told me. Its not worth at all.. it'd be better to move it and go to a shop and purchase it in person. This is not for either 'Beginners' or anyone.. WORST PRODUCT EVER ORDERED! AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK..

37,1.0,"4 of my students already purchased this guitar before coming to me for classes and there are lot of issues in this guitar. For starters, intonation is really bad (which means 'besura' notes in layman's language) The bridge will come out after few months because the quality is cheap. One student has already faced this issue. There is no 'truss rod' as well which means there is no way to adjust action. And there are many more issues which a non-musician won't understand. If you go on OLX, you'll find many of this same guitar lying there to be sold 2nd hand because after joining guitar class and showing it to their guitar teacher, students realize how horrible the guitar is. A humble request for beginners - please don't buy guitar BEFORE joining guitar class. Your guitar teacher doesn't deserve that kind of torture to their EARS! ü§£ Ask your teacher first, and then buy. Don't trust your own judgement. Just because something makes SOUND doesn't mean it's good to use. This is more like a toy, not a guitar. Don't trust the reviews here as well.

The fretboard is so small so that you won't be able to play any chord without annoyed by the fingers touching other strings. The action is extremely high which will result in not just pain, 'injuries' in your fingertips.And the main problem I faced - the low e string is placed out of the fretboard so it cannot be played at all. Refer the picture.The sound quality is fine and comes in a cheap packaging.

52,3.0,"This is my very first experience with a guitar. After using it for half a year, here's how I feel -Sound quality: I honestly didn't expect the guitar to sound this good. And it didn't, at first. But once I tuned it properly... Voila! It's rich, it's full, and one cannot possibly ask for more at this price! (Rating: 4.5/5)Build quality: The guitar's lightweight and doesn't feel very sturdy, however, apart from a few dents incurred due to accidental collisions with other objects, it's still in one piece. Being a budget offering, it doesn't have a truss rod, which makes the neck prone to bending, but I haven't had that happen to me yet. The strings are of low quality though and had begun to rust within the first fortnight itself. (Rating: 3.5/5)Comfort: This is one area where this guitar is absolute crap. Especially for a beginner. The action - or the distance between the strings and the fretboard - is a bit too much, making it that much harder for a newbie to master the art of playing a guitar. Even if you're determined enough to persist with it, there's no way you'll be able to play it for extended periods of time - without inflicting serious damage upon your fingers, that is. (Rating: 1.5/5)Final verdict: This is not meant for people who are serious about learning how to play a guitar. It's for those wanting to take a 'test drive' before committing fully to that idea. Or, if you're like me and just need a stress-buster (of the musical kind) to help you unwind after a long day at work - this guitar should suffice. It's nothing more, nothing less.

This would be my third guitar purchase but this one for my cousin to learn as a beginner and while it has not bad of a sound, It does feel pretty flimsy. It broke the E string on very first tuning. They do give extra set of strings but of course. Frets are subtle for beginners not to get their fingers busted by strings. Other than that, I don't see my cousin moving around a lot with it as carelessly as one should with their instrument. Feels like made of very thin wood.",16 January 2020

Hence without much investment, I was looking for an average quality guitar.This guitar does the job, although the quality is definitely at par with Yahama or Faith guitars. If you are a pre-beginner and wants to learn the basic strumming, fingering and chords, this guitar will do the job. Once you reach a beginner or intermediate level, you can go ahead with better quality guitars.You also get extra set of strings, 2 picks and an average quality bag.I broke A string on the very first day while trying to tune the guitar, hence extra set of string comes handy. Be careful with tuning.If someone is a pro and has used quality guitars, they might find this guitar below average. But for pre-beginners like me, it just does the job.I got this for 2200 but I have seen a few people buying it for 1900 to 2100 as well. If you are getting it under 2500, its a fair deal I guess.

Because the sound quality is really very poor it also only has 18 frets, acoustic guitars have 20. It shouldn't really make a difference since you wouldn't be playing that high when first starting out until you reach 1-2 years.TLDR: try to push your budget a bit more and consider buying a dreadnought guitar.

They were not found. But then only when I got the new guitar I realised they were inside the guitar bag's side pocket. The moment I opened the cardboard box, I knew the neck was broken before I can take the guitar out of the box - just via the transparent polythene package.So thanks to Amazon for replacing it quickly, but at the same time, caution to those who are ordering this guitar to just pay attention to the package detail and inform the delivery person in advance.

So I would suggest not to waste yout money on these kinds of guitar. Even if you are a beginner and if you can spend 2-3K extra then plz buy a good guitar in 5K segment. This I would not suggest to anyone. As the action is high you will face a lot of difficulty in pressing the strings.,11 October 2021
67,2.0,"Hi guys,This guitar is not a bad guitarOnly if you feel like you wanna experiment with playing guitarBut I do not recommend it if you're extremely serious about taking up guitar.There are amazing guitar s if you increase your price range a bit (maybe 4000 rupees). Because this guitar only has 19 frets and is extremely hard to okay because of high action. The tuning legs are of low quality and sound quality is average at bestPlease think about buying guitar s from bands like kaps, kadence or even Yamaha (the f310 is an amazing choice for everyone)Hope I was helpful.",2 January 2020

70,3.0,I was searching for a good guitar and I found this one. The reviews were good. But the wasn't too good. It's just average. This is my detailed review.ProsIt is very cheap.Good colour and attractive bodyConsI have seen many reviews saying that it is good for beginners. But it is not. It's action is very high and it will be difficult to play this . For those who don't know what action is it is the distance between strings and fret. It is very high which makes it difficult to play.Also it is getting out of tune very frequently.If you can buy a better one please do.If this your only choice then it's up to you,9 August 2020
71,4.0,Very good for a beginner.Guitar is superb.Tune it with somebody whose professional or use Guitar Tuna app. Or Yousician.I only have a problem with the guitar cover the straps are weak and the cover is of cheap quality. Weak stitches.Could charge a bit extra and provide quality cover and a stand and tuner .That would make it a perfect deal.But then in 2000 it's fine. Can get the cover stitched.Overall happy with the purchase.,20 June 2020

(5/5)Experience (3/5)Great quality except for stainless strings.",25 October 2019
73,1.0,"Do not buy this product, even if you're an absolute beginner!I received this guitar yesterday and immediately learnt that the guitar action is too high. For those who don't know what guitar action is: it is the distance between a string and the fretboard of the guitar. While guitars are meant to have 0.2-0.25 mm of action ideally, the one I received had it as 0.5mm, making it unplayable. As a beginner you may not notice this right away, but playing anything on this guitar will be impossible for you and you'll wonder if something is wrong with you.I have ordered a replacement from Amazon, will update my review based on the replacement guitar.PS: you cannot adjust this without taking it to a shop, which will cost you a lot. It's better to just add a bit to your budget and get a better, playable guitar at 6-7k.",26 September 2020
74,4.0,"Good quality guitar... However the string quality isn't very durable .. the first string broke on tuning and when replaced by the extra set of strings ...It broke again... Had to buy from a music store... However... My guitar ""sir"" did say that the quality of the guitar was good except that there is a certain level of buzzing that the strings produced in initially... It did fade away with time.... and especially since it came with guitar case and picks etc... It is value for money. Only my first string has broken... The others are still intact... So hence giving 4 stars for this product... I would recommend it to beginners to buy it. Have been using it for more than a month now",27 June 2019

I am a beginner so didn‚Äôt want to spend much on a guitar at this stage so bought it based on the reviews. Overall a good quality inexpensive guitar.,10 March 2019
77,3.0,The first guitar which I received had crack on its neck. As soon as I started tuning it the crack got widened up. So I asked for an exchange. Within 2 days I got exchange product which has a dent and small crack on the bottom part. I asked for exchange but they refused saying an order can be replaced only once. They are ok to give me a full refund by returning guitar. But I'm not sure I'll get an guitar with an offer price of 1700 in future. So I'm ok with it since damage is minimal and does not affect the tuning.Sound quality is goodStrings are not good. Better to change it with good grade strings.Product packaging and making is not all upto the mark. Guitar has cracks or damage in any one of the place.Overall a good guitar for a beginner untill he learns to play in a short period of time,26 January 2022
78,1.0,"Do not buy this product, I repeat ""DO NOT"". The strings are absolutely the worst quality, and the distance between the fret and the strings are too much.

80,3.0,"First off, this is an insanely cheap product. So keep that in mind. The fretboard is completely flat so it's really hard to play bar chords.The sound quality is okay at best.

91,1.0,The Action is very high. It's way higher than ordinary high. The Action is the gap between the strings and the base board. A professional guitarist will not be able to play the guitar having action this high. It will hurt your fingers. So if you are a beginner then please check the action. If it's too high then replace it. I opted for replacement but i don't know if they will send the guitar with same action.,30 January 2020

106,4.0,Perfect for kids who are very much interested about the guitar and want to learn it as it is compact but for beginners I'd say not worth the shot.

134,2.0,"I'm a beginner and I thought I would not need high priced guitars for just practising beginner lessons and other basic stuff. When I got the guitar, I was surprised. The guitar had a good tone. I learnt a lot of basic stuff with this guitar. But the strings are low quality and the action is very high (the advertisement is false - almost 6mm at 12th fret and 3mm at first fret). You'll hurt your fingers if you play for more than an hour and you can't barre the strings completely because of high action. Even the fret heights are uneven. So, my advice is that you go for branded guitars like Yamaha(you'll get a good budget acoustic guitar around 8k). Please don't buy this one.

4036,5.0,"I am a complete novice to the world of guitaring. Still going by the feel of it I can say I have received a good product for the money I have spent. Looks sleek and has an appealing well polished look. Could instantly start strikeing the cords after a little bit of intutive tuning, and it all sounded soothing and melodious. Packaging requires a special mention as it was simple out of the world! Came in a huuuuuuuge box that was huge enough to contain a 50"" LED inside. It was all wrapped in a never-ending array of miniature sized plastic air cussions, that, as an add on, could serve as an interesting toy, if u have kids in your home. Initially on I could not find the belt, the extra set of strings etc that were mentioned in the product description, and thought they were missing; but shortly after did discover them inside the side pocket on the the guitar bag. Everyone around was happy to take a look at it, and happier still after trying their hands on it ‚ò∫. Being a complete novice can't comment much on the technicalities of  it but can say this much: it looks great, feels good to hold on to, sounds melodious and brigs a smile on the faces of people around. Highly recommended!",15 October 2016
4037,4.0,"This guitar was much better than i was expecting at this lowest peice.The quality of its wood & the black matellic color with shine polish makes it premium.If we talk about its component you will get 2 wire sets & two chip for playing this.it comes also with a carring bag in which you will have a strap to hang it on your sholder.Last & final the sound quality because i,m nat a professional guitar player thats why i cant define the sound quality how it was but i just can say that the guitar was so cheap & its stand on my openion.",21 April 2018
4038,1.0,"For the price, I didn't expect a great guitar. However, I'd like to say a few things.1. Package came very well protected and undamaged.2. I was surprised to see the SIZE of the guitar, I'd say about half the size of a normal guitar (meaning it's more for a 7 to 10 years old}.I wish the seller was more direct to mention this. I definitely WON'T HAVE BOUGHT this if i knew the size was so small. I'll surely down vote the seller if possible.3. Guitar was undamaged4. Guitar came with a pair of cheap but usable plectrums, a set of steel strings, a synthetic material strap and a cheap looking plasticy carry bag.5. There is only one knob to sling the guitar strap (on the right side of the guitar) and the guitar strap is completely USELESS without being unable to be attached to 2 sides.6. Playing the guitar.... On such a small guitar, I expected toy like sound. However, they were playable and most keys were sort of acceptable. But since the strings were high, fingers hurts quickly.Also I noted that chords played closer to the body of the guitar tends to sound muffled and off tune.7. Finally, I am going to keep the guitar just in case my son (2 years 4 months now) may learn guitar when he grows up.To be honest, I am pissed that such an important fact was HIDDEN from buyers.As I said, I won't have bought this if I knew the size of this guitar",22 May 2017

The carry bag, strap, strings supplied were of good quality. One can't expect more. Thank you Amazon once again.",6 March 2016
4041,4.0,"Writing my review after 6 months. This is my 1st and still my only guitar. The guitar is really awesome for a beginner, or someone who justs want to play for fun.Do, not hesitate. Just go for it. You, will never regret your decision.Pros.1. The guitar build quality is very good. You will never feel, it is 2000 rupees.2. The strings are long lasting, if used properly.3. That means, the music is also to the right tone.4. The, bag given in the package is also of good quality, though it does not have any padding.5. The guitar is very lightweight and very portable.Cons. Didn't find many.1. The main problem with is guitar, or any other low price guitar is, the tuning does not stay for very long time.But this should not be a problem, as it is always adviced to tune the guitar before playing.Tuning app : Guitar tuna.This will really have some important moments of  your guitar playing future..",16 May 2017
4042,1.0,"The 'action' (distance between fretboard and strings) height is way too much. Not at all for beginners, as they will never be able to learn on it ever. Because of this huge action height, the finger tips would sour very quickly, trying to press the strings over the frets, I am afraid. Even for a fine veteran guitarist, the high action height means poor playability of the guitar. The overall product quality is horrible. And there is no truss-rod in the fretboard to make any adjustments, if one wishes. Moreover, the fretboard itself is awful and is made up of plastic, and would give-in any day. The top wood is very thin and does not look durable. Not worth a single rupee. And there is no money-back return policy. You can, at best, only ask for a replacement. So think twice before buying it.",16 May 2017
4043,4.0,The action on the neck is too much so its super hard to play with . I realise its a risk you take when buying guitars online but this was too much . Besides that problem the guitar is well made and a good beginner guitar.,23 July 2017
4044,3.0,"I bought it for my kid. I got it for Rs.1700/- and that is the price of just a toy!Pros:1. The guitar is good looking, light weight, a bit small. Suited for kids.2. Cover, straps, picks and extra strings were there as promised.Cons:1. Fret board uneven. The dots for the 3rd 5th and 7th are protruding out, making bends and slides almost impossible without getting hurt.2. No truss rod and the fret-board is bent. Natural harmonic and fretted note at the 12th fret for all the strings are off by almost a semitone.3. Frequent de-tuning.The guitar could be a good starter for a slide guitar novice .It  is quite ok if you just want to sing along playing chords. (Do not mix top fretted chords and open chords with bottom fretted chords in a song, it will be almost a semitone off.)Three stars are for the price, looks and accessories.",23 October 2016
4045,5.0,This piece of guitar is amazing. I purchased it in an offer and the value of product to the money's worth is quiet good. The looks are attractive and the sound is great with the money's worth. If you are beginner this product is for you. Go for it. I like it. Glad I purchased this.,9 January 2018
4046,4.0,"I am a beginner level player, and this was my first guitar. So here's what I feel about it.It is a good looking, decent quality guitar with decent strings and good sound. I have tried guitars at shops, but they were all high priced and I was looking for something which is low ranged because I didn't know whether guitar is actually my cup of tea.The size is decent for most girls and teenage boys (I am a teenage girl). If it was any bigger, it would have been pretty huge for me to handle.The whole package at this price is a treat. You get extra strings, 2 plectrums, strap and a bag. All items are of decent quality according to the price.The strings are made of steel. Many people had this doubt as it's written nylon in the description.It is a single body guitar, and it sounds good and looks fine. You won't find it cheap looking in any way. It's made of wood, which isn't of the best quality, but a fine one.The action of the guitar is decent. It's not the best that I have played, but it's fine for the cost.It's not difficult to tune, though I struggled for the first tuning when I got it. It stays in tune for pretty long, I only have to tune mine about once every day, to make sure and adjust the slight difference (of about -2 or -3 in some chords). So that is really good.Final verdict- I don't know about the advanced players, but if you are a newbie then this can be your first guitar. It's cheap, and provides a full package at this price. Also, you can upgrade the guitar when you reach a higher level without feeling guilty.",2 May 2017

It has three frets less only 18 frets so if you are pro guitarist I dont recommend this one...nd the guitar cathes scratches and dust easily as it is black..Sound produced by guitar is also descent..I am beginner too so can't say exactly is the guitar sound perfect..according to me it's goodOver all I would say its a great deal for beginners at low price with good quality guitar..Hope this review helped.",26 January 2017

4053,1.0,"Since my kid is left handed, went to the guitar shop to change string for left handed use. The guy at the shop said, this is worst quality of guitar and you will be lucky if it will last for more than 6 months. So far 3/4 different guitar experts have cautioned about not buying these type of guitars as these are not well made and have trouble tuning. The string break easily.

4059,4.0,"I received the guitar on 18th April. It came just like I expected. The guitar was not broken or damaged and was brand new. It is an extremely low priced guitar intended for beginners or just for practice. It's sound and acoustics is the best part for me. My pros and cons are as follows:Pros :1. Light in weight.2. Really awesome sound considering it's price.3. Stylish4. Low price5. Availability of extra stringsCons:1. The fretboard is made out of plastic!2. Not so good finish. Minor scratches and dents are there.3. High string action (distance btw. Fretboard and strings). Plus, the strings are really hard to press on the first fret.4. No amplifier input plug.5. Extremely thin plectrums.6. Cleaning it with cloth caused some scratches.Overall, it is a very good choice if you want to learn guitar as it is such a good price.

4080,5.0,"Great sound quality for an acoustic guitar at this dirt cheap price, comparable to Rs. 8k+ ones. I wish there was bridge adjustment mechanism as the steel strings are real hard to press at the top frets, you got to develop callous on ur fingertips for few days before you can play those, unlike classical with nylon strings. Worth every penny though.",20 August 2017

4084,4.0,"Once I bought a chinese guitar from a shop which looked awesome but had serious fabrication problem while resulted in bad sound and difficulty in playing. This one is exactly opposite.

4088,3.0,"Packing was not that good. I didn't received the guitar in a hugh box it was in it's own box, which was disappointing. Quality of the sound is fair. Looks great. But the only problem with this guitar is that it's nearly impossible to tune E string, when you tune it ,it breaks. You have to spend 200‚Çπ to buy good strings from the shop.OVERALL it's fair.

Once the neckbending starts, it's hard to repair or continue playing.Bass: The material is very thin and there is no bass if you thump.Build Quality: The build material is very average.Overall it's a good guitar to start with but if you build interest you have to save bucks for a better one.Thank you",21 February 2018

4095,3.0,"Decent guitar, but if you are ambitious about playing a guitar, then you might want to save a bit more money and move on to other brands.Some of the major setbacks that I've found in it are:1. ACTION IS WAY TO HIGH. AND ITS DETRIMENTAL FOR YOUR FINGERTIPS.2. Has only 18 frets, so many of the popular guitar solos can't be played.3.

Don't buy this!!!,25 July 2018
4098,4.0,"I bought this guitar for a family member who was interested in learning to play the guitar. The sound is alright though the bass isn't as deep and pronounced. Its body is smooth and looks much more premium than the price suggests. The action between the strings and the fretboard is quite low making it easy to hold chords and play cleanly without much effort.However, I had a problem with the tuning pegs upon changing strings. That's about the only issue so far.",12 April 2018

I have played it almost every day for maybe half an hour to a couple of hours each time. I have got back to playing the guitar after a gap of about 20 years, and so I am a beginner and have not really ""worked"" the guitar a lot. So, I guess it is just the build quality that is beginning to show. The action of the guitar has increased slowly and now at the 12th fret, the gap between the 6th string and the fret is over 5 mm. Not good. 2 mm would have been nice.Having said that, for a beginner like me, who plays mostly chords playing the low strings as high as the 10th-12th frets is quite uncommon.",16 May 2017

Also, build quality is not good, however for 2k it's justifiable.If they can fix it, its 5/5 from me. Until then 4/5.Edit 1:Tried my old guitar and released strings are really far from fret board in this guitar, it's really tough to play bar chords as compared to my rocks guitar where I am easily able to. But yes I have learned due to this Guitar as we need to apply a lot pressure in this one for bar or chords.",2 October 2018

4589,4.0,Best in this price . I got it in 2200. Nothing can b better in this range.Strings quality is cheap u need to buy another one .Overall best product,26 May 2017
4590,3.0,"Primo, I would like to give you an advice that if you want to learn guitar please have a decent start with a decent guitar.Now coming to this guitar,It has an unusually high action(gap between strings and neck) that causes enough hindrance in playing. And best things about this is that you can not lower the action as this guitar is built without a truss rod in it.This is the best thing about this guitar. No truss rod. Woah a guitar without truss rod!!Guitar is somewhat small for an adult. If it's gonna be your first guitar then it's fine as you don't have a comparison in mind. Infact it's a 38"" (18 frets) compared to other full size guitars I have they're 41""(22 frets).Wood is very light weight. Feels cheap and it is cheap.Actually I didn't find any positive thing about this guitar except the price it comes at. For the price around 2k you can get only this much.So If you're an absolute beginner, don't want to spend much and still want to hit the strings then you can go for it. If you end up not continuing it will not hurt your economy much. Because many a time peeps just buy an expensive guitar in a fit of excitement and end up quitting on it. Because as you know or you don't, playing guitar proficiently is a matter of years. Not everyone makes it to that. So it's ok to start with this cheap guitar and if your interest keeps you going further, you can buy a better one after some time.Still I would say,Invest Atleast 3.5-4k and get a proper guitar. If you actually want to learn and play.And Many people are saying the guitar is good and they are not at all talking about the absence of truss rod. Either they don't know much about it Or they are paid.If you don't know about truss rod let me brief you, it is a steel rod in the neck of the guitar and it is used to adjust the action(height) of strings. And sometimes neck gets bent and if it does not have truss rod the bent neck can not be corrected and your guitar is done.I'm SVKPlease press 'helpful' if you liked my review of the product.",17 September 2018

And you take it into your hands you cant help but think how cheap it looks even considering the price point.If you are a beginner, you definitely want a guitar that is well built... u can compromise on the looks for a low priced guitar but it should be sturdy one. The neck of this guitar ( at least the one that amazon or whoever the actual seller is tried selling me ) is soooo weak that you will break it in couple of weeks... especially if you are a beginner you are more likely to break it due to incorrect pressure and left hand positioning on the guitar neck.The one I received...had no protective packagingPaint work was shabby and uneven...u can feel it and see it cheap2nd string was bent or crooked (exactly over the hole area)The neck was not goodI cannot comment on how it sounds..coz i looked at it and did not want to play it all....may be the lowest priced ... but wots the point of spending even that 2k if it doesnot entice you into playing it???The many good reviews of the product made me buy this with confidence but all my confidence was shaken and was utterly disappointed with the seller and the item that was tried to be sold to me.Simply giving 3 stars on assumption that I was unlucky to have received a fraudulent piece and others might have received genuine or good product.",3 May 2017

4640,3.0,"The guitar for the price of Rs.2000 is pretty good.Below are the pros and cons of the guitar:-Pros-1.It is pretty good if you are not sure whether or not you're gonna continue playing guitar.2.Its sound is bright for the size of its sound hole and body.3.Spaces between the frets are pretty accurate so if you decide to continue playing it will not be of great problem.Cons:-1.It does not have a truss rod.A truss rod is supposed to support a guitars neck which is the fret part.2.If you already know how to play a guitar DO NOT buy this product instead invest a little more and go for better brands.2.It has only 18 frets which is not a problem for beginners but will create a chaos once you have to use notes above the 18th fret.3.Its finishing and wood work inside the body is not accurate which may result in the guitar sounding odd at times.4.The tuning pegs are very hard and will give you a problem while you have to tune it.To conclude:-Only buy this guitar if you're not sure whether or not you'll continue playing guitar.If you've made tour mind that you wanna play guitar,invest just a little more and you'll open a gate to many other better brands.If you're already a guitarist;stay away.",23 January 2021

4642,3.0,"#Overall Review after using for a week....I am a moderate guitarist and I borrowed this guitar from my friend just for the review sake, as soon as i held this guitar in my hands i knew it is something very cheap. The neck and the built is very poor and i'm sure after a few months of non usage the neck of the guitar will bent for sure because of the string pressure. A lot of finger pressure is required to press down the chords (more than usual). The resonance of the material is not so good and that's why the sound is not like a actual acoustic guitar. It is less like a standard guitar and more of a toy guitar. Sorry people but this is the true, don't buy if you already know a bit about playing guitar, this is not for you and even the fret board is not of full size, it is smaller. This guitar might be suitable for complete novice beginners , and i still say that it might. You can buy this only if you are planning to change your guitar after 3 or 4 months. Don't think this would stay for a long run.i would suggest to raise up your budget little bit and get a better guitar...you might get a superior and better product just by adding a few hundred bucks more. Rest depends on you if you still want to go with it then buy.",7 November 2017

4657,2.0,"I have this guitar since 4 years now. I bought this when I wasn't having any idea about guitars, it's quality, etc. I found it cheap so I purchased it.But later on when I joined a guitar class, I got to know that it's sound quality & overall wood quality isn't good.There's no metal rod to support the neck which is why it can get bent easily.The wood is just ""Bhusa ply"" which means it's made from saw dust so it isn't good.I'd suggest that don't buy Juarez. There are many other brands like Aria, hobmer, revolt, etc which are available offline with just 1k-2k extra around 4.5k, 5k, etc",10 August 2021

4661,5.0,"Its excellent, I don't think any more words required",13 March 2017
4662,1.0,HORRIBLE GUITAR1) Strings are really bad quality. They hurt your fingers and you can not play at all if u have dry skin.2) the sound quality is so bad. I heard a song from a an acoustic guitar which was like much more expensive than this one and the sound was awesome there. For this guitar u really have to press hard on the fret board for clear sound and that too is not good. The f major chord sound comes realy weird in this3) the distanceeeeeee between the fret board and strings is so much that u can't play properly without hurting your fingers.4) in the first month itself it got scratches and dents all over it. 5) it won't last long cz it doesn't have a rod inside it so if u don't play it for a while all the strings will come out. A good quality guitar alwayysss stands long.PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GUITAR TO SAVE MONEY OR IF U THINK THAT IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING. YOU'RE REALLY GONNA REGRET IT,26 December 2020
4663,1.0,"Our first guitar pack delivered so light packing and loose strings and one string broken and hanging around.

4671,1.0,"This guitar's quality is not equal to the MRP 6990. If you compare this product with Yamaha and holmer of MRP 9000 their quality is top most  . It looks to me that the MRP of this guitar is inflated. When I saw this guitar, it looks like manufacturer has made this guitar for name sake. There is thin wood. The strings are not springs like the one in Yamaha guitar's. The body is glossy which shows finger prints when touched. The tuners are not durable.",13 January 2017
4672,1.0,Didnt like the product will you please change the product that is not working proper,16 January 2017
4673,1.0,"Honest Review:Pros: If your budget is really tight then you can go for this guitar. Overall at this price range it is satisfactory.Cons:1. Guitar does not have truss rod. After 2-3 months action of the guitar will increase and you will be struggling to play the guitar and cannot adjust the action as well.2. Built quality is very cheap. While sliding over the frets fingers get hurt.3. Sound quality is average as the sound box is not big.4. After few months tuning keys of the guitar catch rust and you can barely move the tuning keys. Im facing this difficulty for B and E_high string.If you are a beginner and think that you will learn with a cheap guitar first and then buy a good guitar then please don't believe this myth. Branded and good quality guitar produce superb quality sound and keep you motivated. If you fall in this trap of cheap guitar which will not produce a premium sound you may end up demotivated and ultimately leave playing guitar. So if you can afford, if you have some extra money, buy a good guitar, save some money, wait for few months and save and buy a branded guitar around 10-15K budget.",23 December 2020

4686,2.0,"Hi Namaste everyone,I just brought this guitar 2 weeks before,I'm just a beginner so I don't know much about guitar. So I thought of buying a budget guitar to study basics and I started my classes...Now I realized that my guitars fret board have a bend it's a born bend friends. And this guitar have no truss rod so it's not possible for you to adjust the fret bend... I suggest you all to buy a much better guitar ( beginner's too). Don't go for this kind of budget one, I don't know what to do with this guitar now.maybe I place in my show case..Guys collect money and buy a good guitar above mentioned is the truth I faced.i studied about this fret bends then I understood that this budget guitar's fret board will automatically bend with in 6 months, and will not get proper quality sound and also finger pain.So say no... And go for a good one God bless you all",2 June 2020
4687,2.0,The gap between string are much more,18 March 2017
4688,1.0,Most Important point that no one will tell about you this guitar that this guitar is irreparable. Once the guitar action gets high you can't fix it in the shop because it doesn't have a truss rod which is a very important part of a guitar. Its tone is also very poor. I will suggest you buy a toy rather than buying this. Please buy a guitar from an instrument shop nearby. Maybe it's a little expensive than this but that will sound like a guitar.,11 January 2021

Just becoz the cost is low doesnt mean u can play well on this guitar well its my opinion.  Now i am gonna buy new one.. its my fault who bought this guitar out of excitement.. plz dont do the mistake like me.. buy a good one tho its costly its gonna stay longet throughout your journey. ALL THE BEST",7 September 2020
4692,1.0,"Most of the good reviewers must not have played this guitar for more than a week. When I initially bought it I thought it was a great purchase. I am a beginner so initial weeks of learning guitar was going well. Then I came across the dreaded F Major bar chord, that's when I realized the glaring problem this guitar has. The Action (distance between guitar and fretboard) is too high ! I tried modifying it using allen key provided but to no avail. I showed it to a friend of mine (who is a pro) who said the guitar design is flawed. Please don't buy this if you're genuinely trying to learn guitar. If you are trying to learn on your own you will easily get duped by such faulty designs. Get a recommendation from a friend before buying !",18 January 2021

SO YOU CAN FIX IT WHEN THE ACTION INCREASES.As far as Juarez goes , i hope i get to visit your factory one day so i can burn it to the ground and take a leak on the ashes , stop fooling people you cheapsters.

4696,1.0,1. The normal action on a guitar is 2.8 mm to 3 mm whereas on this guitar the action is 6 mm which is definitely going to hurt the fingers more than it should.2. The quality of the strings is poor.You need to tune this guitar twice or thrice a day or maybe even more which is terrible3. The sound quality is fine for this price .4. Overall this guitar is not worth it and it's better to purchase a guitar that you can play without losing a finger or two in the process,22 November 2020

4915,5.0,"First things first...do not expect a Fender or Yamaha quality guitar to pop out of that package, since you are not paying that much. The guitar is really good for beginners and the price is too awesome. I have played other high-end guitars like Fender, Pluto and Gibson, but this guitar is a real delight to play.Surprising thing is that the guitar in pic has a white seam border, which looks a bit odd, but the guitar I received was seamless black and awesome looking. I got three pics instead of two as shown, and other accessories as shown like the strap and extra string set. Be careful while attaching the strap to the guitar as it has only one fastening end at the bottom. You can attach the other end at the neck of the guitar using the black string they have provided. You can the video tutorial on YouTube on How to attach the strap if only one fastening end is given.The only disappointment is regarding the product finish. The paint is off in few places and the finish only tells you that it is not a high-end guitar. Amazon went way overboard with the packaging of the guitar, which I felt was very unnecessary. There was more than 100 bubble sheets for the protection.Pros:1. Amazing Looking Guitar2. Great Sound3. Light Weight.4. Strings and Wood Quality is very good.Cons.1. One size smaller than standard acoustic guitar (I am not sure).2. Finish is not that overwhelming.3. Guitar Action (distance between Fret board and Strings) is quite high.Overall, just go for it, its worth your money.",13 June 2016
